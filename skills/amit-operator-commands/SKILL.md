description: Route Amit's heavier operator phrases into safe Codex workflows. Use for worker/status control such as "check td", "check cc", "check workers", "go td", "approved", "ss status", "did ss call?", "clear context", "debug tight", "fast work", "commit all", "push all", "merge", "cleanup", "TTL cleanup", and similar repo/AWS operator command shorthands. Do not trigger this skill only for simple global shortcuts like "next", "save context", or "save handoff" unless the repo lacks those global rules.

# Amit Operator Commands

Use this skill when Amit gives a short command phrase that implies a heavier
workflow rather than a single shell command.

Do not load this skill only to handle these global shortcuts when the active
instructions already define them:

- `next`
- `save context`
- `save handoff`
- `ask me`

Those should usually be handled from current repo truth with minimal context.
Use this skill when the shortcut expands into worker orchestration, cleanup,
git mutation, supervisor status, or a clean restart packet.

## Core rules

- Keep output short, practical, and current-state only.
- The owning repository's authority and adopted shared policy override router
  defaults. Shortcuts never grant a new mutation, merge, cleanup or handoff.
  Preserve explicit approval, backup, retention and no-go requirements.
- Prefer repo truth over chat memory: `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, optional
  `HANDOFF.md`, branch/MR/PR text, and current goal files when available.
- For old evidence or broad context questions, read `INDEX.md` / `MANIFEST.tsv`
  first when present, then use `qmd-agent-search` or targeted `rg` before raw
  evidence scans.
- Preserve local-only context. Do not stage secrets, `AGENTS.override.md`, raw evidence bundles, `.codex-local/`, or unrelated local files.
- Save durable task evidence under `~/.AGENTS-temp/<repo>/`.
- Before deleting or archiving context/rule files, create a backup under `~/back/`.
- For AWS cleanup, start read-only and load `~/.agent/AWS.md` before inventory or deletion.

## Shared context contract

- `AGENTS.md` = stable repo rules.
- `CONTEXT.md` = current truth and restart state.
- `HANDOFF.md` = explicit transfer snapshot only when Amit asks for handoff.
- Worker goal files = execution instructions, not repo truth.
- Worker `RESULT.md` files and `.done` markers = evidence and completion
  signals.
- `PLANS.md` and `STATUS.md` are retired unless the repo explicitly says
  otherwise.
- `/compact` should preserve this same model; it must not create `HANDOFF.md`
  or revive old plan/status files by itself.

## Command router

### Hot global shortcuts

These commands should stay cheap. If global `AGENTS.md` already defines them,
follow the global rule and avoid loading more old evidence than needed.

- `ask me`:
  - stop before implementation.
  - restate the request.
  - propose the smallest safe plan.
  - name files/systems to touch.
  - list no-go gates and validation.
  - ask one exact approval question.
  - wait for Amit's `go`.
- `next`, `next?`, `what next`:
  - inspect current repo truth and latest worker markers.
  - return one recommended next action plus up to two options.
  - do not run skills only to invent more work.
- `save context`:
  - update only `CONTEXT.md`.
  - do not create `HANDOFF.md` or dated snapshots.
- `save handoff`:
  - update `CONTEXT.md` and `HANDOFF.md`.
  - keep it compact and decision-grade.

### Short worker commands

Keep Amit's shortcuts, but resolve facts before choosing an action. A lane
nickname is a lookup key, not a recipe for constructing a path or choosing the
latest goal.

Source order and resolution gate:

1. Read the owning repository's `AGENTS.md`, applicable SPEC and current request.
2. For preparation or execution, resolve one exact approved goal ID/revision,
   goal path, repository/workspace, worker role and verified thread mapping.
3. Read only its named context, result and marker; confirm current branch/PR
   state when relevant. Use the approved private registry, not guessed paths.
4. Confirm the selected authority mode, allowed action and explicit `Reply-To`.
   A dated context, pane label, filename order or `safe_to_continue=yes` cannot
   supply missing approval or identity.

If a required fact is missing, ambiguous or stale, stop and name that fact.
Do not create a lane, goal, prompt copy, worker or replacement mapping to fill
it. Status-only reads need a verified target, not an execution grant. Creating
a first goal needs an explicit preparation request defining its target and
output path; a bare `prep` is not that request.

Alias routing after this gate:

- `check <lane>`, `status <lane>`, `<lane>?`, `update <lane>`,
  `check cc`, `check aa`, `check td`, `check pat`, `check workers`,
  `are all workers active?`: status only; read identified markers/results and
  use bounded observation when needed. No edits, new goals or AWS mutation.
- `ss status`, `did ss call?`, `is ss working?`: inspect identified last-run
  evidence; report its timestamp and unknown live state without assuming a
  wake failure or claiming a historical service is running.
- `next?`, `next`, `what next`: recommend one next action, without dispatch.
- `prep <lane>`, `prepare <lane>`, `goal <lane>`,
  `$prepare-worker-goal <goal>`: invoke
  [prepare-worker-goal](../prepare-worker-goal/SKILL.md) only for the resolved
  approved preparation/revision scope. Do not run the goal or overwrite active
  work. Preparation approval is not execution approval.
- `go <lane>`, `run <lane>`, `continue <lane>`, `give goal <lane>`,
  `$run-worker-goal <goal>`: invoke
  [run-worker-goal](../run-worker-goal/SKILL.md) only for the exact approved
  prepared goal and verified mapping. `go` preserves REVIEW/EDIT/COMPLETE and
  explicit no-merge/no-mutation limits; it never upgrades authority.
- `approved`, `approve and run <lane>`: proceed only when that approval binds
  unambiguously to the resolved goal and requested action. Otherwise stop.
- `approved for all`, `take any approval from me`, `approved - upgrade SPEC`:
  do not infer new goals, permission changes or a bulk dispatch. Resolve each
  intended goal and existing safety boundary before acting.

Worker-state routing:

- An active or uncertain goal must not be overwritten or submitted again.
  `Working`/`Ready` is an observation, not dispatch or completion proof.
- A blocked result needs the blocker resolved and a permitted continuation;
  a done marker needs its matching result and controller acceptance checked.
- Missing goal or mapping means report the missing fact, not automatically
  prepare a replacement. Separately requested side work must not conflict.
- Persistent Codex delivery follows the
  [native queue protocol](https://github.com/amitkarpe/agent-os/blob/535be4b923cb996d85613d970159d71499ad75ae/kb/playbooks/delegation/codex-native-controller-worker-protocol.md):
  a valid receipt ends that attempt; uncertain admission stays blocked pending
  reconciliation. Never use tmux/composer/SS as fallback or duplicate delivery.

Examples:

- `check td` -> status of the verified mapping, or report that it is missing.
- `prep td` -> prepare the specifically approved goal, or report missing scope.
- `go td` -> dispatch the exact approved goal only after the resolution gate.
- `continue td` -> reconcile that goal's state; never select the newest file.
- Bare `go` or `approved` -> continue only the one explicit resolved target and
  its current mode; otherwise stop and report the missing target/approval.

Return `State`, `Recommended`, `Needs approval`, and `Next command` only when a
safe next command is actually known. Never invent a command from a nickname.

### `clear context`

Goal: prepare a genuinely clean restart packet so the next session can reload a
small file set instead of inheriting a large compacted chat.

Use when Amit says:

- `clear context`
- `clean start`
- `reset context`
- `start team context`

Rules:

- Refresh `CONTEXT.md` and `HANDOFF.md` when those files exist in the repo.
- Write one compact reset packet under `~/.AGENTS-temp/<repo>/`.
- Include only:
  - read-first order
  - current truth
  - active workers and marker paths
  - blockers and approvals already granted
  - next safe command
  - what not to reload
- Do not create many dated snapshots.
- Do not bulk-copy chat history.
- Stop after writing the packet and tell Amit to start the clean session from
  that packet.
- Be explicit that the current session context cannot be reduced in-place; the
  packet is for a fresh session.

Output:
- `Updated`
- `Reset packet`
- `Read first`
- `Next`

### `dump_context_fast`

Goal: update only `CONTEXT.md` from current state.

Use when Amit says:

- `dump_context_fast`
- `dump_context_fast: ...`

Rules:

- Do not create dated `CLEAN_*`, `HANDOFF_*`, or extra `CONTEXT_*` files.
- Do not load compact prompts, old handoff files, GOAL files, result packets,
  or broad history unless required to identify the active blocker.
- Use current status commands, active tmux panes, git status, and latest result
  filenames only.
- Update the repo or lane `CONTEXT.md`.
- Preserve only current truth, blocker, next action, read-first order, and
  latest evidence paths.
- Stop after updating.

Output:
- `Updated`
- `Latest evidence`
- `Next`

### `save handoff`

Goal: create or refresh `HANDOFF.md` for a session/milestone boundary.

Use when Amit says:

- `save handoff`
- `clean start handoff`
- `session handoff`

Rules:

- This updates `CONTEXT.md` and `HANDOFF.md`.
- Keep it decision-grade: current truth, active blockers, read-first order,
  latest evidence paths, decisions, no-go gates, and lessons that affect future
  execution.
- Do not bulk-copy old chat history.
- Back up existing `HANDOFF.md` before major replacement.
- Do not create `PLANS.md`, `STATUS.md`, or dated handoff files unless Amit
  explicitly asks.

Output:
- `Updated`
- `Read first`
- `Next`

### `save context`

Goal: update `CONTEXT.md`.

Rule:

- Update `CONTEXT.md` with current truth, blocker, next action, evidence paths,
  read-first order, and active no-go gates.
- Do not create `HANDOFF.md` unless Amit says `save handoff`.
- Do not create `PLANS.md`, `STATUS.md`, dated context snapshots, or compact
  resume files.

Output:
- `Updated`
- `Next`

### `what next` / `next`

Goal: choose the next useful task or goal.

Workflow:
1. Read the smallest relevant repo context:
   - `INDEX.md` / `MANIFEST.tsv` first when present and the question touches
     old evidence, cleanup, or lane history
   - `CONTEXT.md`, guidance files, git status, and active
     PR/MR/issue if present
2. Use `qmd-agent-search "<query>"` for old summarized evidence when available;
   use targeted `rg` for exact IDs or strings.
3. Check `/goal` when runtime exposes it, but do not treat it as source of truth.
4. Return a short shortlist of 1-3 next actions, with one recommended default.
5. Do not edit files unless Amit also asks to implement.

Output:
- `State`
- `Recommended`
- `Options`

### `debug tight`

Goal: understand and fix the smallest real failure.

Workflow:
1. Reproduce or confirm the smallest failure.
2. Inspect only relevant files/logs.
3. Make the smallest safe fix.
4. Run the narrowest useful validation.
5. Stop before refactors or cleanup detours.

Output:
- `Problem`
- `Cause`
- `Fix`
- `Validated`
- `Next`

### `fast work`

Goal: complete a small private-repo task at MVP quality.

Workflow:
1. Inspect only relevant files.
2. Implement the smallest useful change.
3. Run small validation.
4. Update `CONTEXT.md` only if task state changed.
5. Commit only when the repo changed and the change is coherent.

Output:
- `Changed`
- `Validated`
- `Git`
- `Next`

### `commit all`

Goal: make one accurate local commit.

Workflow:
1. Inspect `git status --short`, unstaged diff, staged diff, ignored/local-only rules, and recent commits.
2. Exclude secrets, raw evidence, unrelated local-only files, and user edits outside the requested scope.
3. Run the smallest relevant validation; use `bash -n` for shell changes.
4. Stage intended files only.
5. Commit with a specific message that matches the actual diff.
6. Do not push.

Output:
- `Committed`
- `Validation`
- `Not staged`
- `Next`

### `push all`

Goal: publish the current branch safely.

Workflow:
1. If dirty, run the `commit all` workflow first.
2. Confirm current branch and upstream.
3. Push the current branch.
4. Report PR/MR URL or remote branch if discoverable.
5. Do not merge.

Output:
- `Pushed`
- `Branch`
- `Remote`
- `Next`

### `merge`

Goal: finish the PR/MR path.

Workflow:
1. Run `commit all` and `push all` behavior as needed.
2. Discover the active PR/MR from branch metadata, `gh`, `glab`, or repo remotes.
3. Update the PR/MR/issue summary with what changed, validation, and any residual risk.
4. Verify required checks when tooling exposes them.
5. Merge only when target, checks, and merge method are unambiguous.
6. After merge, close linked issue only when the PR/MR or user request clearly indicates it.
7. Clean up local branch only after confirming merge success.

Stop if:
- multiple PRs/MRs match
- checks are failing or unknown and required
- merge target is ambiguous
- deletion would remove user work

### `cleanup`

Goal: remove unwanted local task debris without losing useful history.

Workflow:
1. Read current task/plan/goal and git status.
2. Read `INDEX.md` / `MANIFEST.tsv` first when present.
3. Inventory candidate generated files: temp scripts, raw JSON/log dumps, one-off reports, stale compact files, caches, and local scratch.
4. Keep curated docs, final reports, tracked status files, repo truth, closeout
   packets, decision packets, cleanup proof, MR/Jira references, and scan summaries.
5. Stop with `blocked_cleanup` when retention or ownership is unclear; do not
   archive/compress or delete merely to resolve uncertainty.
6. Back up before deleting anything that might contain context.
7. Do not delete tracked files unless Amit explicitly asked for that tracked-file cleanup.
8. Follow the adopted shared temporary-state lifecycle: controller acceptance,
   verified durable evidence and exact-path cleanup approval are required.
   Preserve active, dirty, held and unknown work. Age, TTL or `delete_after`
   alone is not approval. Record disposition outside any removed path.

Output:
- `Removed`
- `Backed up`
- `Kept`
- `Needs decision`

### `TTL cleanup`

Goal: clean up expired or unwanted temporary AWS resources.

Workflow:
1. Load `~/.agent/AWS.md`.
2. Start read-only: inventory resources with TTL/cleanup tags and repo resource records.
3. Save inventory/evidence under `~/.AGENTS-temp/<repo>/`.
4. Treat expired `ttl` + `cleanup=delete` resources as candidates, not automatic deletion, unless Amit explicitly asked to delete them.
5. Before deleting, report resource type, ID, name, region/account/profile, TTL, cleanup tag, and planned command.
6. Delete only resources matching the approved candidate set.
7. Verify deletion and save final evidence.

Output:
- `Candidates`
- `Deleted`
- `Verified`
- `Kept`
- `Needs decision`
