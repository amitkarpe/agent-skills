name: prepare-worker-goal
description: Prepare or revise one bounded persistent-worker goal when the user explicitly requests a delegation plan or goal file. Do not trigger for generic planning, tiny direct tasks, status checks, or execution of an already approved goal; use run-worker-goal for dispatch.

# Prepare Worker Goal

Use this skill when the task is not “execute now,” but “prepare the best worker
goal first.”

This skill prepares scope; [run-worker-goal](../run-worker-goal/SKILL.md) handles
approved dispatch. Shared policy owns approval, test and lifecycle rules; the
vendor adapter owns model selection. Do not reproduce those policies in every
goal.

## Context Loading

Always resolve the owning Issue/PR (or named goal) and current branch/HEAD.
On a **cold start** (first repo entry or untrusted cached state), read the
repository's `AGENTS.md` once and the exact files required for the task. On a
**warm continuation**, reuse loaded rules and fingerprints; read only the
latest relevant authorized Issue/PR/goal delta, current state needed for the
next action, and exact required files. Read `CONTEXT.md`, `SPEC.md`, or
`ROADMAP.md` only when referenced, changed, required for the next action, or
needed to recover stale/missing/contradictory state. Reload broader history for
a repo switch, context mismatch, material rule change, new safety/authority
domain, or explicit request.

## Core Behavior

- Think before delegation.
- Read only the minimum repo/live truth needed.
- Use the exact approved lane/goal path; do not create another prompt copy.
- Review the goal critically before it is sent.
- Cite exact existing approval for AWS, stable services, IAM, networking or
  production-like state; ask only when that approval is missing or ambiguous.
- Do not execute the worker unless Amit explicitly asks to run it.
- Do not replace or dispatch over an active goal. Prepare a non-conflicting
  sidecar only when explicitly authorized. Treat UI state as a hint; reconcile
  the current goal/result before selecting a continuation.

## When To Use Subagents

Use subagents when one or more are true:

- repo truth is spread across multiple large files
- live state and repo state must be compared
- goal needs independent risk/audit review
- multiple facts can be gathered safely in parallel

Do not use subagents for tiny linear tasks.

## Goal Quality Checklist

Before sending a worker goal, confirm:

- one bounded objective
- one verifiable outcome and the shortest existing path to prove it
- which repo-owned workflow is reused, and why any new runner or file is needed
- for code changes, the base revision, intended files, approximate change
  budget and the condition that would require re-scoping
- explicit repo and lane
- explicit read-first files
- allowed mutation
- no-go boundaries
- stop conditions
- success criteria
- evidence path
- done marker path
- cleanup/rollback expectation
- worker model/session expectation when relevant
- whether the worker should use internal subagents
- exact goal ID/revision and `Reply-To`
- cleanup owner, approved durable destination and retention decision

For a POC or MVP, keep the goal and change budget small enough to review as one
proof. If the work needs a new dependency, service, cloud resource, parallel
runner or unrelated UI, reconcile that scope with the owning SPEC and approval
before adding it. Passing tests alone does not justify a new runner when an
existing path can provide the requested proof.

## Worker Status Gate

Before writing or refreshing a worker goal:

1. Resolve the exact owning Issue/PR, approved goal, and current branch/HEAD.
2. Read `CONTEXT.md` only if the Issue/goal references it, its fingerprint
   changed, or it is needed to resolve stale or uncertain state.
3. Read the exact current marker path named by the goal or private registry.
4. Read the referenced `RESULT.md` only when the marker exists or the context
   points to it.
5. Inspect tmux only if the marker/result is stale or the worker may still be
   running.

Rules:

- Active or uncertain goal: do not overwrite or duplicate it. A separate
  preparation task needs explicit non-conflicting scope.
- Marker `blocked`: prepare a follow-up goal only after the blocker is
  understood and the needed approval/Ops ask is explicit.
- Marker `done safe_to_continue=yes`: reconcile the matching result and
  controller decision before proposing a SPEC-covered next action. The marker
  does not grant new scope or cleanup authority.
- Multiple possible goals: stop and ask for lane/path instead of guessing.
- AWS mutation goal: name the exact applicable approval or the missing decision.
- Do not dispatch here. Use the [native queue protocol](https://github.com/amitkarpe/agent-os/blob/535be4b923cb996d85613d970159d71499ad75ae/kb/playbooks/delegation/codex-native-controller-worker-protocol.md)
  only in an authorized execution step; no composer fallback.

## Goal File Shape

```text
# <lane> goal - <short name>

Controller timestamp:
Goal ID/revision:
Worker role and verified thread:
Reply-To:
Repo:
Exact lane/result/marker paths:
Cleanup owner / durable destination / retention decision:
SPEC and exact approval reference:
Base revision and change budget (for code changes):

Objective:
- <one bounded objective>

Read first:
1. Owning Issue/PR and current branch/HEAD
2. <this goal file>
3. AGENTS.md on cold start or when its fingerprint changed; CONTEXT.md/SPEC.md
   only when referenced, changed, required for the next action, or needed for
   recovery

Allowed mutation:
- <read-only / exact files / one host / one AWS action>

No-go boundaries:
- <what must not be touched>

Phase 0 Probe:
- <checks before mutation>

MVP Proof:
- <smallest proof>

Full Lane only if:
- <gates>

Stop immediately if:
- <blockers>

Success condition:
- <what proves done>

Closeout:
- write RESULT.md
- update done marker
- notify the exact Reply-To using the adopted native queue protocol
- include next safe action and retention obligation
- wait for controller acceptance; cleanup requires separate exact-path authority
```

## Output Contract

For Amit approval, use:

```text
State:
- ...

Recommended:
- ...

Needs approval:
- yes/no, and why

Next command:
- ...
```

After preparing:

```text
Prepared:
- <goal file path>

Worker:
- <session/repo>

Needs approval:
- <yes/no and why>

Next command:
- <for example: $run-worker-goal <approved-goal>>
```
